= How To Update Wim =
If you used the recommended installation method, a simple `git pull` inside the
`wim` directory is enough to update all the configs.
Use the _VimPlug_ commands to update the plugins. See: [[#Misc Keybindings|Misc Keybindings]] 

If for some reason you corrupt or destroy the symlinks that are setup between
the `wim` directory and the `~/.vim` directory, you will only have to run the
`update.sh` script that will be automatically generated after the initial
installation.

=  What If I Forget The Keybindings? =
Either enter this wiki and consult the mappings tables, or read the Cheat40
file inside vim, or run the fzf `:Maps` command by pressing `<Leader>M` in
normal mode.

= How To Read The Cheat File =
Simply issue `:Cheat40` inside Vim

= How To Use An Alternative Keymap? =
If you are bilingual, or wish to use a secondry keymap, do the following:

At line _594_ of `vimrc` change `g:alt_enabled = 0` to `1` to enable the alt
keymap functions Then use `:call ListKeymapFiles()` to find your desired
keymap. Change the value of `g:alt_keymap = 'persian'` to match your language
keymap.

Now you can use `C-p` in normal mode and insert mode to change your keymap and
still be able to use the usual vim normal commands.

= ZWNJ =
You can uncomment the two lines at line _590_ of the `vimrc` to enable vim to
hide/conceal the ZWNJ character and replace it with `|` sign. 

`call matchadd('Conceal', '\%u200c', 10, -1, {'conceal':'|'})`
`set conceallevel=2 concealcursor=nv`

= Plugins Guide = 
This plugins guide is not about including a Tl;Dr to every plugin! Yet it will 
cover some of the important ones that are not covered in the tables below. You 
can always check out the individual repos of each plugin and see their README

= Stargate =
Literally magic! Written in vim9script, super fast and super efficient!
 type `\f` in normal mode, followed by a character you want to jump to and 
 follow the hints.
See: https://github.com/monkoose/vim9-stargate 

= Surround =
See: https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround

= vimdict =
My own humble plugin for integrating dict cli into vim in a seamless way.

You can either place your cursor on a word and issue `:Dict`, or optionally map
it to a key:
	`nnoremap <F2> :Dict<CR>`
See: https://github.com/wolandark/vimdict

= vim-ddgpb =
Another one of my own plugins.
Yea the name is trash but its pretty useful. 
Once enabled, you can search a word under the cursor in your browser, or a
chunk of text that is visually selected. This plugin also allows you to submit
a visually selected text to the 0x0.st paste bin.

This plugin binds `\s` and `\p` and `F3` key for visual search, paste bin and 
word under cursor respectively.
See: https://github.com/wolandark/vim-ddgpb/tree/master

= vim-live-server = 
Yet another one of my own plugins.😁 
A liveserver plugin for Vim. 
See: https://github.com/wolandark/vim-live-server

= commentary =
Use [count]`gc`[motion] to comment out code.

Example: 
`3gcj` will comment out `3` lines to the direction of `j`, which is down.
`gcc` will comment whole lines.
`gcG` will comment from current line to the end of the file.
etc ...

See: https://github.com/tpope/vim-commentary

_Note:_ if you're using Vim 9.1+, there is an internal _comment_ plugin from
habamax which is writen in vim9script. To use that instead of tpop's
_commentary_ do the following:

- Disable _commentary_ by commenting out it's entry in the plugins section of the `vimrc`

- Inside Vim, issue:
`:packadd comment` 

- Use the internal _comment_ plugin the same way as _commentary_. The
  Keybindings are the same.

- To make the addition of the plugin permanent, add `packadd comment` to the
  end of the `vimrc`

== rsi == 
rsi is another tpop plugin that provides basic readline bindings in vim's insert
mode. Such as `C-a` to go to the beginning of the line, `C-e` to go to the end
of the line etc ...

See: https://github.com/tpope/vim-rsi/blob/master/doc/rsi.txt

== CoC ==
coc.nvim is really straight Forward LSP client. If you want to add LSP support
for a language, you only have to install the appropriate LSP server. Consult 
the list [here](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim/wiki/Language-servers) and
pick a language server to install,

Then simply install it by following the guide on the README which is usually
something like, `:CocInstall coc-pyright` or `:CocInstall coc-css` etc ...

When you install the language server, you can start using it right away. 
CoC usually doesn't need much messing around with to get things to work
properly, unlike most other similar plugins.

To avoid going to the browser, you can also use coc-marketplace. See [[#coc-marketplace|coc-marketplace]]

== coc-marketplace ==
Issue this command: 
`CocList marketplace` 

Then start searching for the language server or programming language that you need. 
Press enter and install the language server.

== coc-explorer == 
explorer is coc's file explorer. I personally think they are much better ways
to open files than to waste time with a file explorer, but still, coc-explorer
is automatically installed in Wim.

Inside explorer window, press `?` to see the commands. You can make dirs,
files, rename, copy, paste etc from explorer
